# Discord-205.0-IPA
An IPA file for Discord 205.0 which can be installed with Trollstore or sideloaded with Sideloadly. This is for those who haven't gotten used to the mobile UI redesign and want to go back to the old one. The only downside is that polls won't display properly.


**UPDATE: 13 April 2025**

I've added an Enmity IPA to this repo, for those of you who want to install plugins. Though the icon is the same as those of newer Discord versions, it is also on version 205. Be careful of what you install and read the descriptions thoroughly, since some plugins may cause Discord to crash. I recommend installing the AddonManager plugin first, then working from there.
