# Discord-205.0-IPA
An IPA file for Discord 205.0. You can install it with Trollstore or sideload it with Sideloadly. This is for those who haven't gotten used to the mobile UI redesign and want to go back to the old one.


**UPDATE: 13 April 2025**

I've added an Enmity IPA to this repo, also on version 205, for those of you who want to install plugins.
